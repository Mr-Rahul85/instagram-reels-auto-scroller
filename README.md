# Instagram Reels Auto-Scroller

Tired of manually scrolling through Instagram Reels? This lightweight Chrome extension enhances your viewing experience by automatically scrolling to the next video as soon as the current one finishes. Just sit back, and let the Reels roll!

## üöÄ Features

* **ü§ñ Automatic Scrolling:** Intelligently detects when a Reel has ended and smoothly scrolls to the next one.
* **üéØ Smart Activation:** The extension only runs when you're on the Instagram Reels page, so it won't interfere with your other browsing.
* **üñ±Ô∏è Simple On/Off Toggle:** A simple popup allows you to enable or disable the auto-scrolling feature with a single click.

## üì¶ Download & Installation Instructions

Since this extension is not on the Chrome Web Store, you need to load it into your browser manually. It's a simple process!

1.  **Download the Code**
    * Download the project files from the source (e.g., from GitHub via "Code" -> "Download ZIP").

2.  **Unzip the Folder**
    * Find the downloaded \`.zip\` file on your computer and extract it. You will get a folder containing files like \`manifest.json\`, \`content.js\`, etc. Place this folder somewhere you won't accidentally delete it.

3.  **Load the Extension in Chrome**
    * Open your Google Chrome browser.
    * Go to the extensions management page by typing **\`chrome://extensions\`** into the address bar and pressing **Enter**.
    * In the top-right corner, turn **ON** the switch labeled **"Developer mode"**.
    * Click the **"Load unpacked"** button.
    * A file browser window will pop up. Navigate to and select the folder you unzipped in step 2.
    * The **Instagram Reels Auto-Scroller** extension will now appear in your list of extensions!

## üñ±Ô∏è How to Use

1.  Make sure the extension is enabled in \`chrome://extensions\`.
2.  Navigate to [www.instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com) and go to the **Reels** section.
3.  The extension will be active by default. Let a Reel play to the end, and it should automatically scroll to the next one.
4.  To disable the feature, click the extension's icon in the Chrome toolbar and use the toggle switch in the popup.
